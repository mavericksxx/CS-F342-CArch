1.Write a MIPS program to take two integer values from the user, add these values and print the output

2.Write a MIPS program to take the value of 'N' from the user, find the sum of first "N" natural numbers and print the output

int i, sum = 0;
for (i=1; i <= N; i++)
   sum = sum + i

3. Write a MIPS program to compute the factorial of a whole number N, where assume N > 0

factorial=1;
   for(i=1; i<=N; i++)
   {
     factorial *= i;
   }
